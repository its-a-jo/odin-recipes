For the recipes project from The Odin Project

<!-- *remember to action git commands from terminal a la git workflow with
    git add = stage a file
    git commit -m "snapshot name" = lable the commitment
    git status = check file statuses
    git log = see snapshots
    git push origin main = push to GitHub repository
- commit every meaningful change in code to create timeline

self relfection
    forgot to commit lemonade and pizza recipes apart
    if anything had happened, I'd have lost both files
SOLUTION
    commit after creating and adding boiler frame for each HTML file, then again when adding content- AND in the middle of content creation if I need to leave my work station -->
